Additional Notes
----------------

Since this is again a NUMA machine, I perfomrmed two sets of benchmarks, one
normal and one benchmark using the program 'numactl' to set the cpu and memory
affinity.

zsh» numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 ./bench suite 6 > half-viznode07.out

The results from the benchmark using numactl are in the files with the 'half-'
prefix. Interestingly enough, the base memcpy speed improves, however, we get
much better performance with blosc if we use all available cores. This is all
evidence for the fact that blosc becomes incredibly useful for increasing the
memory-bandwidth of NUMA architectures.
